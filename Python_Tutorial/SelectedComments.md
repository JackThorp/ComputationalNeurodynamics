Selected student comments after the Python tutorial
---------------------------------------------------

Thanks to everyone who came along and for the helpful feedback. I've taken the
priviledge of correcting some typos in your messages. Here are some of the
tutorial Python-esque afterthoughts:

- It's a snake?

- Maybe you can also suggest students to go to
  https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python where the Python course is a very
  good learning resource.

- Please use a common coding style (I suggest flake8). It makes the code easier
  to read and it teaches the beginners good coding from the beginning.

- Why not pie thon?

- Ssssssss
